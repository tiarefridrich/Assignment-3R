# Assignment-3R

Surveys_NAsrem.csv is a file containing time-series data for a small mammal community in southern Arizona. Surveys_Nasrem is the original surveys.csv file, found at http://www.datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/data/, with the NAs removed. The fields in this data are record_id, month, day, year, plot_id, species_id, sex, hindfoot_length, and weight.  

This data was collected as a part of a study looking at the effects of rodents and ants on a plant community, which has been running for almost 40 years. This repository was created by Tiare Fridrich, Jeeban Panthi, and Mamoon Ismail in order to analyze this dataset and investigate trends and relationships in the data for Assignment 3 of their Big Data class.  

In this repository are three folders - data_output, figs, and scripts. Data_output includes the surveys_NAsrem.csv dataset. Figs includes .png files of the plots included in the .Rmd file. Scripts include the R scripts that were eventually used to create the R-markdown file. 

Outside of the folders include this README file, several versions of the RMD file, and an ideas.txt file, which includes the ideas originally used for creation of the plots. The "SampleV3.Rmd" file is the final version of the Rmd file, which is what is being submitted for grading. The "SampleV3.html" file is the final knitted file which is being submitted for grading.
